    "question": "What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work (google it)?",
    "answer": "In MongoDB, the aggregate method is a powerful way to perform advanced data processing and analysis on collections. It allows us to perform complex computations and transformations of the stored data on Mongodb. There are some methods of aggregate and each method performs different operations. Some of them are ($match, $project, $group, $sort, $limit, $skip, etc.). / 1.  $match: The $match stage is use to filter the documents in the collection based on certain condition. / 2. $project : The $project stage allows us to shape the output of the aggregation pipeline. / 3. $group: The $group stage is used for grouping documents together based on a specified key or keys. And many more."
